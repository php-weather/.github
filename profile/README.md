# PHP-Weather

There is still a lot to come, but I wanted to create a unified interface to the various weather APIs out there.

So far there are two data providers implemented:

| Provider | URL | Version | API-Version |
| -------- | --- | ------- | ----------- |
| [Bright Sky](https://github.com/php-weather/brightsky) | [https://brightsky.dev](https://brightsky.dev/) | 0.3.0 | 0.3.0 |
| [Open-Meteo](https://github.com/php-weather/open-meteo) | [https://open-meteo.com](https://open-meteo.com) | 0.1.0 | 0.3.0 |
