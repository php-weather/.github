# PHP-Weather

There is still a lot to come, but I wanted to create a unified interface to the various weather APIs out there.

Logo is from [Erik Flower's Weather Icons](https://erikflowers.github.io/weather-icons/)

We have these providers so far:

| Provider | URL | Version | API version |
| -------- | --- | ------- | ----------- |
| [Bright Sky](https://github.com/php-weather/brightsky) | [https://brightsky.dev](https://brightsky.dev) | 0.5.1 | 0.4.* |
| [Open-Meteo](https://github.com/php-weather/open-meteo) | [https://open-meteo.com](https://open-meteo.com) | 0.3.2 | 0.4.* |
| [OpenWeatherMap](https://github.com/php-weather/openweathermap) | [https://openweathermap.org](https://openweathermap.org) | 0.2.1 | 0.4.* |
| [Tomorrow.io](https://github.com/php-weather/tomorrow) | [https://tomorrow.io](https://tomorrow.io) | 0.2.2 | 0.4.* |
